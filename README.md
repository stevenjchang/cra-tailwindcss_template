This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### 'npm run develop'

Runs the app in development mode while watching the tailwind_custom_entry.css file.

### NOTE: Here's what some of the packages do:

- `purgecss` - by default, tailwindcss imports all classes. purgecss removes all unused classes, significantly reducing compiled file size.
- `cssnano` - css minifier + remove css comments
- `autoprefixer` - Parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules using values from the Can I Use website.
